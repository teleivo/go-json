# TODO

* I feel like I am not advancing past the ] in parseArray. On the other hand, it seems to parse nested array well
* add String() string to ast Node interface
* would TokenType also benefit from a String(), printing all caps TRUE, FALSE, ... in errors is not friendly :)
* parse a number
* parse an object

## IDEAS

* adapt lexer to use io.Reader and filename
* provide context to error messages. in what file, line, col is the error.
* write a CLI that takes a JSON from stdin to parse it
* support unicode
* try out fuzzing for testing
* use the parser to write a JSON stats CLI. How many arrays, objects are in the
JSON? How deeply nested is the JSON? How many nodes per type?
